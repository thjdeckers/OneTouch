OneTouch Trampoline Scoring app

This JavaScript app runs on a tablet or in a desktop browser and can be used by judges at Trampolining competitions to enter the scores. It uses the touch interface of a tablet to enter deductions per skill: 1 touch = 0.1 deduction, 2 simultaneous touches (2 fingers) = 0.2 etc. until a max of 0.5 deduction per skill.
By flipping the tablet the total score can be displayed to the audience and there is a complimentary PHP/MySQL server script to which the scores can be uploaded. It is also possible to upload a CSV file based participant list (example included) to the server which can be downloaded to the app.
App localization is available for Dutch, English, German, French, Spanish and Russian.

A video instruction with Dutch and English subtitles can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OduZ-8L-dOI
A new video tutorial how to create and setup the MySQL database for uploading participants and scores will be published here shortly.

The app name is derived both from the touch interface and from trampolining terminology: One Touch is a short warming up before the actual exercise: gymnasts are allowed to do one skill, landing on the trampoline once.
