OneTouch Trampoline Scoring app

This JavaScript app runs on a tablet or in a desktop browser and can be used by judges at Trampolining competitions to enter the scores. It uses the touch interface of a tablet to enter deductions per skill: 1 touch = 0.1 deduction, 2 simultaneous touches (2 fingers) = 0.2 etc. until a max of 0.5 deduction per skill.
By flipping the tablet the total score can be displayed to the audience and there is a complimentary PHP/MySQL server script to which the scores can be uploaded. It is also possible to upload a participant list to the server which can be downloaded to the app.
App localization is available for Dutch, English, German, French, Spanish and Russian.

A video instruction with Dutch and English subtitles can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OduZ-8L-dOI
